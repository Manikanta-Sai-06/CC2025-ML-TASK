# TASK1 "THE CAMPUS_PULSE INITIATIVE":
=>THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS THE SOLUTIONS TO THE THIS TASK1 OF CC2025 ML_TASKS,
=>IN THIS TASK1 THE  DATASET CAPTURES ACADEMIC,DEMOGRAPHIC,AND BEHAVIOIUR INFORMATION FROM  STUDENTS AT TWO SECONDARY SCHOOLS.
# LEVEL-1 "VARIABLE IDENTIFICATION":
=>LIBRARIES USED=("PANDAS","NUMPY","MATPLOTLIB","SEABORN")
=>FOR IDENTIFING FEATURE_1 USED EDA TOOLS =("HISTOGRAM BETWEEN FREQ AND FEATURE_1","CORRELATION HEAT MAP")
=>FOR IDENTIFING FEATURE_2 USED EDA TOOLS =("HISTOGRAM BETWEEN FREQ AND FEATURE_2","CORRELATION HEAT MAP","BOXPLOTS BETWEEN G1,G2,G3 AND       FEATURE_2","BOXPLOT BETWEEN FAILURES AND FEATURE_2")
=>FOR IDENTIFING FEATURE_3 USED EDA TOOLS =("BOXPLOT BETWEEN G1,G2,G3 AND FEATURE_3","CORRELATION HEAT MAP","BOXPLOT BETWEEN DALC AND GOOUT    AND FEATURE_3")
# LEVEL-2 "DATA INTEGRITY AUDIT":
=>FOR FILLING NaN VALUES OF THE DATASET OF DIFFERENT COLUMNS
=>USE .isnull().sum() TO GET THE NO OF NaN VALUES IN THE DATASET(NUMERICAL TYPE)
=>FOR D_TYPE=OBJECT,USED THE MODE OF THE DATA COLUMN TO FILL THE NaN PLACES
=>REMAINING D_TYPE=INT64 ARE Fedu,traveltime,freetime,absences,G2,Feature_1,Feature_2,Feature_3.
=>FOR Feature_2,Feature_3 ARE FILLED BY USING THE MODE OF THE DATA COLUMN
=>CHECKED MEAN OF THE G2,traveltime,freetime,feature_1,Absences USING num[''].mean() function
=>FOR G2,traveltime,freetime,feature_1,Absences ARE FILLED BY USING THE MEDIAN OF THE DATA COLUMN 
=>FILLED USING THE FUNCTION .fillna()
=>PLOTTED BOXPLOT FOR THE FEATURE Fedu IN THAT BOXPLOT THERE ARE NO OUTLIERS AND SYMMETRIC DATA 
=>SO FOR Fedu IS  CAN BE FILLED BY USING THE MEAN OF THE DATA COLUMN BUT MEAN OF FEDU IS NOT INT64 SO NEXT OPTION TO GO IS MEDIAN OR MODE 
=>BUT MODE IS NOT SUITABLE SO CHOOSEN MEDIAN TO FILL NaN ENTERIES IN Fedu.
# LEVEL-3 "EXPLORATORY INSIGHT REPORT":
=>WRITTEN 5 INSIGHTFULL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STUDENT DATA
=>WRITTEN CODE FOR THE BOXPLOTS FOR ALL 5 QUESTIONS USING MATLPLOTLIB(USED num.boxplot)
=>WRITTEN CODE FOR SCATTER PLOTS FOR DALC VS G3 AND ROMANTIC VS G3 FOR MORE CLARITY USING MATPLOTLIB(USED plt.scatter())
